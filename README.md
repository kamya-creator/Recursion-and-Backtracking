# Recursion and Backtracking

This repository is a curated collection of Java implementations focused on **Recursion** and **Backtracking**â€”core concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes a variety of problems ranging from basic recursion to complex backtracking challenges.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository is organized into levels based on problem difficulty and concepts:

### ðŸ”¹ Level 1: Recursion Basics

Fundamental problems to build a strong foundation in recursion.

- `PrintDecreasing.java`
- `PrintIncreasing.java`
- `PrintDecreasingIncreasing.java`
- `Factorial.java`
- `PowerXN.java`
- `MaximumOfArray.java`
- `DisplayArray.java`
- `FirstIndexOfEle.java`
- `LastIndexOfEle.java`
- `AllIndexofEle.java`

### ðŸ”¹ Level 2: Intermediate Recursion

Problems that involve returning values and slightly complex logic.

- `GetResultFromRecursion.java`
- `PrintRecursionResult.java`

### ðŸ”¹ Level 3: Backtracking

Classical problems involving exploration of all possibilities using backtracking.

- `PrintPermutation.java`
- `PrintSubsequence.java`
- `PrintKPC.java`
- `PrintEncodings.java`
- `NQueens.java`
- `SudokuSolver.java`
- `WordBreak.java`
- `PalindromePartitioning.java`
- `AllPalindromicPermutations.java`

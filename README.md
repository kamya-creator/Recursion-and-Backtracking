| `Permutations.java`       | Generates all permutations of a list              |
| `Subsets.java`            | Finds all subsets (power set) of a set            |
| `NQueens.java`            | Solves the N-Queens problem using backtracking    |
| `RatInMaze.java`          | Finds paths for a rat in a maze                   |
| `SudokuSolver.java`       | Solves a Sudoku puzzle                            |

# Recursion and Backtracking

This repository contains a curated collection of problems and solutions focused on **Recursion** and **Backtracking** ‚Äî essential topics in computer science and technical interviews. It is designed for learners preparing for coding interviews and aiming to develop a deep understanding of recursive problem-solving strategies.

## üß† Topics Covered

- Basic recursion techniques
- Recursive tree building
- Backtracking templates
- Classic backtracking problems (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Subsets, Permutations)
- Recursive optimization
